\subsection{Sets and Functions}

\subsubsection{Ordered Pairs}

\begin{definition}[Ordered Pair]
	The \textbf{ordered pair} $(a,b)$ is the set whose members are $\{a\}$ and $\{a,b\}$. In symbols we have
	\begin{align*}
		(a,b) = \{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

This definition ensures that the elements have an order. To show this, this theorem and its proof should suffice.

\begin{theorem}
	\begin{align*}
		(a,b)=(c,d) \Leftrightarrow a=c, b=d
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	If $a=c$ and $b=d$, then 
	\begin{align*}
		(a,b)=\{\{a\}, \{a,b\} = \{\{c\}, \{c,d\}\}=(c,d)
	\end{align*}
	Conversely, suppose that $(a,b)=(c,d)$. Then by our definition we have $\{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\} = \{\{c\}, \{c,d\}\}$. We wish to conclude that $a=c$ and $b=d$. To this end we consider two cases, depending on whether $a=b$ or $a\neq b$.
	
	If $a=b$, then $\{a\} = \{a,b\}$, so $(a,b) = \{\{a\}\}$. Since $(a,b)=(c,d)$, we then have 
	\begin{align*}
		\{\{a\}\} = \{\{c\}, \{c,d\}\}.
	\end{align*}
	The set on the left has only one member, $\{a\}$. Thus the set on the right can have only one member, so $\{c\} = \{c,d\}$, and we can conclude that $c=d$. But then $\{\{a\}\} = \{\{c\}\}$, so $\{a\} = \{c\}$ and $a=c$. Thus $a=b=c=d$.
	
	On the other hand, if $a\neq b$, then from the preceding argument it follows that $c\neq d$. Since $(a,b) = (c,d)$, we must have 
	\begin{align*}
		\{a\} \in \{\{c\}, \{c,d\}\},
	\end{align*}
	which means that $\{a\} = \{c\}$ or $\{a\} = \{c,d\}$. In either case we have $c \in \{a\}$, so $a=c$. Again, since $(a,b)=(c,d)$, we must also have
	\begin{align*}
		\{a,b\} \in \{\{c\}, \{c,d\}\}.
	\end{align*}
	Thus $\{a,b\} = \{c\}$ or $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$. But $\{a,b\}$ has two distinct members and $\{c\}$ has only one, so we must have $\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}$. Now $a=c$, $a\neq b$, and $b\in \{c,d\}$, which implies that $b=d$. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Cartesian Product}
\begin{definition}[Cartesian Product]
	If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then the \textbf{Cartesian product} (or \textbf{cross product}) of $A$ and $B$, written $A\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. In symbols,
	\begin{align*}
		A\times B = \{(a,b):(a\in A) \land (b\in B)\}.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Relation}
\begin{definition}[Relation]
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A \textbf{relation between $A$ and $B$} is any subset R of $A\times B$. We say that an element $a$ in $A$ is \textbf{related} by R to an element $b$ in $B$ if $(a,b)\in \text{R}$, and we often denote this by writing "$a\text{R}b$". The first set $A$ is referred to as the \textbf{domain} of the relation and denoted by dom R. If $B=A$, then we speak of a relation R $\subseteq A\times A$ being a \textbf{relation on A}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Equivalence Relation]
	A relation R on a set $S$ is an \textbf{equivalence relation} if it has the following properties for all $x,y,z \in S$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Reflexive property:} $x$R$x$
		\item \textbf{Symmetric property:} $x$R$y$ $\leftrightarrow$ $y$R$x$
		\item \textbf{Transitive property:} ($x$R$y$ $\land$ $y$R$z$) $\rightarrow$ $x$R$z$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

An example for a \textbf{equivalence relation} is the relation "is parallel to" when considering all lines in the plane, if we agree that a line is parallel to itself.

\begin{definition}[Equivalence Class]
	Given an equivalence relation R on a set $S$, the \textbf{equivalence class} with respect to R of $x\in S$ is the set
	\begin{align*}
		E_x = \{y\in S:y\text{R}x\}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}
