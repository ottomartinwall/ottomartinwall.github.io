\textbf{Software Engineer (Embedded)}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the open Software Engineer position that you have announced. It has been a goal of mine to do the type of work that I hope to be doing at your organisation and I look forward to meet new people there. I have a master's degree in Technical Physics and I have therefore been training my problem solving, numerical and analytical skills to a very high degree. I have extensive experience with the languages C\#, JavaScript and Python, which should align well with your requirements. In addition, I enjoy working with networking, servers and small embedded systems as a hobby at home, so I am familiar with Linux/GNU, CAN, Ethernet and FlexRay.

In my previous work at Logiwaste in Sweden, I worked with embedded control systems for garbage suction. Good structure and scalability was and will be of top priority. I believe that my knowledge and experience from that work will transfer well to the projects at your company.

In my free time, I passionately enjoy working with mathematics and physics. I also frequently go running, preferably in the forest, and I value my relationships very highly so I spend much time with my family and friends.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to learning more about the position that you have open at your company and about the work that you are doing.

Yours faithfully
