\textbf{1. Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Romeo and Juliet:} Romeo and Juliet is about a forbidden love between Romeo and Juliet, both from two different powerful families who's age old vendetta has erupted into bloodshed. Juliet fakes her death to be able to be with Romeo, but she can't reach him before he kills himself because he believes that she is dead. She then kills herself too.
	\item \textbf{Julius Ceasar:} Julius Ceasar is about the assassination of that said man. He gains too much power and to defend democracy, he has to be killed (which didn't result in anything better really).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. In what ways are the stories similiar?}
The stories are similiar in the way that both are very dramatic, both have people in great power, and both contain deaths.

\textbf{3. Can you detect a "typical" Shakespearean style in the stories, sort of like a similiarity in the themes? If so, how?}
I'd say that this question is quite similiar to question 2. I choose to respond with that same response.

I don't want to read them. In my free time, I'd rather do other things.
